      "Today’s NFT technology has had a dramatic impact on the market, including money, sales, and even business models, and Michael has shared it with us, with five major businesses that are now the most well-developed and centralized, with financial, game, publication, art, and creative, and technology that can effectively help or even change their ways of doing business. Recently, many people have asked me how to get into the Web3 business, which is always mysterious, only skilled people can do it, but we need to learn how to do business, besides technology, which has a lot of different players, such as business, business, business, business, business, and so on. At the same time, there are different ways of working than in the Web2 industry, where a lot of people work in 7x24 and sometimes spend their time in different ways at night, which is the other side of the living working environment, where the precariousness of the working hours is matched by a relatively high remuneration for the Web2. Referring to Token 2049, Michael also said that, although the market is a bear market, there are different kinds of projects that can be seen at the conference, such as encoded currency payments, public chain development and decentralised finance, and so on, there are different ways in which encryption can be built in different ways, so we have to keep going.
